The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **MCP server** — any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) can invoke Nox skills via 3 tools: `nox_list`, `nox_skill`, `nox_agent`
- **One-liner curl install** — `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LDGUEST/NOX/main/install.sh | bash` clones to `~/.nox` and installs
- MCP server auto-registers in `~/.claude/.mcp.json` during install
- GitHub topics: `claude-code`, `gemini-cli`, `codex-cli`, `ai-skills`, `developer-tools`, `devops`, `security`

### Changed
- `install.sh` — bootstrap preamble for curl pipe detection + MCP server registration section
- `uninstall.sh` — MCP cleanup (removes from `.mcp.json`) + updated hook list to all 19 hooks + `~/.nox` cleanup hint
- Bumped `gemini-extension.json` version to 1.5.0

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- `/nox:guardrails` skill — inline safety checks that mirror all 19 Claude Code hooks for Gemini and Codex users
- Guardrails wired into 11 skills across all 3 CLIs (full-phase, quick-phase, iterate, unloop, refactor, tdd, review, audit, security, deploy, push)
- Skill count: 31 → 32

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- 12 new hooks expanding coverage from 2 to 8 hook events (19 total):
  - `auto-context` (SessionStart) — injects project state on every session start
  - `branch-protect` (PreToolUse) — blocks commits/pushes to main/master
  - `commit-lint` (PreToolUse) — enforces Conventional Commits format
  - `test-regression-guard` (PostToolUse) — tracks test pass/fail, warns on regression
  - `file-size-guard` (PreToolUse) — blocks oversized file writes (>500KB)
  - `todo-tracker` (PostToolUse) — detects and logs new TODO/FIXME comments
  - `compact-saver` (PreCompact) — saves context checkpoint before compaction
  - `session-logger` (Stop) — logs session summaries for work history
  - `agent-tracker` (SubagentStart) — detects runaway agent loops
  - `prompt-guard` (UserPromptSubmit) — warns on vague/destructive prompts
  - `drift-detector` (PostToolUse) — warns on large uncommitted diffs
  - `memory-auto-save` (Stop) — reminds to update DEBUGGING.md after fixes
- README "Why Nox?" panel with 3-column layout (Ship Faster, Catch Everything, Sleep Through It)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-06

  - `test` merged into `tdd` (tdd now includes test generation mode)
  - `simplify` merged into `review` (review now includes complexity check)
  - `error` merged into `diagnose` (diagnose now includes error investigation)
- Updated all cross-references in help-forge, full-phase, quick-phase, README, CONTRIBUTING

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-06

- 7 Claude Code hooks with `--with-hooks` install flag (`destructive-guard`, `sync-guard`, `secret-scanner`, `debug-reminder`, `build-tracker`, `cost-alert`, `notify-complete` + `notify-timer-start`)
- Two-Layer Defense integration (hooks + agents) in `full-phase`, `iterate`, `unloop`
